## Features

1. **Sobel Edge Detection**: Detects edges in X and Y directions.
2. **Gaussian Blurring**: Reduces image noise with a Gaussian filter.
3. **Gabor Filtering**: Analyzes texture with directional Gabor filters.
4. **Laplacian Edge Detection**: Applies Laplacian to highlight edges.
5. **Fourier Transform**: Computes and displays the frequency spectrum.
6. **Non-Maximum Suppression**: Suppresses non-maximum edges to refine results.
