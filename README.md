# **Image_Preprosseing.ipynb**

1. Sobel Edge Detection: 
Displays the original image alongside edges detected in the X and Y directions and their combination.

2. Gaussian Blurring:
Shows the effect of Gaussian blurring on a grayscale image.

3. Gabor Filtering:
Visualizes texture analysis at multiple orientations.

4. Laplacian Edge Detection:
Highlights edges using the Laplacian operator.

5. Fourier Transform:
Computes and displays the magnitude spectrum.

6. Non-Maximum Suppression:
Refines Sobel edge detection results by suppressing non-maximum values.

7. Cartoon Effect:
Applies cartoon effect to the image, making it look like a cartoon.

8. Pencil Sketch Effect:
Transforms the image into a pencil sketch.

9. Histogram Equalization:
Improves the contrast of the image using histogram equalization.

10. CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization):
Enhances the image contrast more effectively than standard histogram equalization.
