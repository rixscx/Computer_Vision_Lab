## **Usage**

Open the Jupyter Notebook: Start Jupyter Notebook and open cv_lab5.ipynb:

```bash
        jupyter notebook cv_lab5.ipynb
```
**Run the Cells:** Follow the cells in the notebook to visualize each step of edge detection and filtering techniques.

Example Outputs

### **Sobel Edge Detection:**
Displays the original image alongside edges detected in the X and Y directions and their combination.

### **Gaussian Blurring:**
Shows the effect of Gaussian blurring on a grayscale image.

### **Gabor Filtering:**
Visualizes texture analysis at multiple orientations.

### **Laplacian Edge Detection:**
Highlights edges using the Laplacian operator.

### **Fourier Transform:**
Computes and displays the magnitude spectrum.

### **Non-Maximum Suppression:**
Refines Sobel edge detection results by suppressing non-maximum values.

## Features

1. **Sobel Edge Detection**: Detects edges in X and Y directions.
2. **Gaussian Blurring**: Reduces image noise with a Gaussian filter.
3. **Gabor Filtering**: Analyzes texture with directional Gabor filters.
4. **Laplacian Edge Detection**: Applies Laplacian to highlight edges.
5. **Fourier Transform**: Computes and displays the frequency spectrum.
6. **Non-Maximum Suppression**: Suppresses non-maximum edges to refine results.
